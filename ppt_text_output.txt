Improve size and design of legs to:

Improve the aesthetics also when you use it outside the refrigerator
Improve the ergonomy when you use the handle to open the drawer since they give more space to manage
white plastic cap to improve aesthetics and make the handle visible: all transparent would be confusing
close any visible open part, see CAD file  
recessed cylinder to make it all aligned and clean, see cad file

REMOVE ANY OPENING FROM THE FRONT SINCE IS AESTHETICALL UNPLEASENT
place them on top and bottom side, it will not change the air flow in our concern.

IF POSSIBLE CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE ICE CUBES TO MAKE THEM MORE UNIQUE. WE PRESENTED THIS DESIGN PROPOSAL FOR THE INTERIOR DELIVERY DATE:
the ice cubes have a different shape for easier use in glasses. additionally, from a design perspective, the rounded shape is more attractive.
